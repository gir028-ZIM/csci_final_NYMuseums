# csci_final_NYMuseums
A website built for CSCI_E12 featuring personal reviews about Museums in New York City that I have visited. 

TO DO
1. Acquire a data set of NYC museums. 
2. Upload the data set to GitHub.
3. Organize files.
4. Begin coding an index and other pathways so that data in specific pages (locations, museum categories) can be pulled. 
    Using HTML
    Using ASTRO
5. Build grids and use CSS or Tailwind to make other aesthetic changes.

GOING DEEPER
1. If I had more time to go deeper in this build, I would have liked to make a JSON data set for museums in Boston.
2.  If I had more time, I would have liked to make a website about my collection of antique drugstore bottles, but that would need time for me to take over 100 photos of individual bottles.
3.  If I had more time, I would have liked to make a quiz that users can click through when they are indecisive about what museums to visit on their trip.
