## Instructions generated by Claude for CSCI E-12 Coursework Project
## Project Overview
This is a **CSCI E-12 coursework project** - a website showcasing museums in New York City. The project is in early development stage (foundation work in progress).

**Tech Stack**: Astro (static site generator), HTML, CSS/Tailwind CSS
**Goal**: Build a searchable museum directory organized by location and category with data-driven pages

---

## Current Development Status & Tasks
1. **Data Acquisition** (In Progress)
   - Source NYC museums dataset (must be committed to GitHub)
   - Store data in repository (likely JSON or CSV format in `/public` or `/src/data`)

2. **Project Structure** (Next Phase)
   - Organize files into standard Astro structure:
     - `/src/pages/` - Route pages (index.astro, locations.astro, categories.astro)
     - `/src/components/` - Reusable UI components
     - `/src/data/` - Museum dataset files

3. **Dynamic Pages** (Priority)
   - Build pathways to pull museum data for:
     - **Location-based pages**: Filter museums by NYC neighborhoods/boroughs
     - **Category-based pages**: Filter museums by type (art, science, history, etc.)
   - Use Astro's static generation with `.astro` components to render data dynamically

4. **Styling** (Final Phase)
   - Build responsive grids using CSS Grid or Tailwind CSS utility classes
   - Apply aesthetics using Tailwind (utility-first approach preferred)

---

## Astro-Specific Conventions

When building in Astro:

- **File-based routing**: Place `.astro` files in `/src/pages/` - each file creates a route
- **Dynamic routes**: Use `[slug].astro` pattern for location/category pages
- **Data integration**: Import JSON/dataset files directly into `.astro` files
- **Component structure**: Put reusable `.astro` components in `/src/components/`
- **Building grids**: Use Tailwind CSS classes (`grid`, `grid-cols-3`, etc.) or CSS Grid (`display: grid`)

Example pattern for dynamic pages:
```astro
// src/pages/locations/[slug].astro
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const museums = import.meta.glob('../../data/*.json')
  // Filter by location...
}
```

## Data & Integration Points

- **Museum Dataset**: Will be the single source of truth
  - Expected format: JSON array of museum objects with fields like `name`, `location`, `category`, `address`
  - Location strategy: Store in version control (GitHub) rather than external APIs (as per README)

---

## Key Development Patterns

1. **Static Generation First**: Astro generates static HTML at build time - no server-side rendering needed
2. **Component Reusability**: Extract common UI patterns (museum cards, filters) into `.astro` components
3. **CSS-in-JS Alternative**: Scoped styles within `.astro` files or external CSS modules
4. **Data-Driven Content**: Loop through dataset to render museum listings programmatically

---

## Build & Deployment Notes

- Project type: Static site (Astro defaults to SSG)
- Deployment target: Can be deployed to any static hosting (GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify)
- No database required - data stored as static files in repository

---

## Coursework Context

This is an educational project for CSCI E-12. Focus on:
- Clean, understandable code structure
- Proper component separation
- Effective use of Astro's features for this use case
- Accessible, responsive UI patterns
