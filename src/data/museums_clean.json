    "review": "This is a must for any fine art lover! If you want to see it all...You will need 8 hours minimum! The Met does not dissapoint anyone from contemporary lovers to the wannabe egyptoligist. My personal favorite is the portrain of Madame X, by Sargent. I jumped for joy when I saw here for the first time that everyone in the gallery stared at me (how emabarrasing!). The layout of every single gallery is filled to the brim but still feels spacious and not overwhelming. The european wing was closed when I went, but its just another reason for me to go back again. HOT TIP: The Costumes and Textiles gallery is an extra ticket."

    "review": "Its difficult for me to pick just one things I love about the ANHM because I loved so much of it. The exhibits make a brilliant effort to be interactive and immersive. The hall of minerals was spellbinding, and I particularly loved the use of augmented reality in that exhibit. The live insect section is mezmorizing I would have stayed for ours watching the ants and other animals if my friends were not there. The downside? There are not enough chairs or benches, and its constistently rowded and loud. If you are willing to brave the chaos... you can sit with Teaddy Roselvelt's statue near the exit!"
